What is a "proxy"?
========================= >

A proxy is a server that sits between the client (browser) and your Express app. It forwards requests to your app. Example: Cloudflare, Heroku, or a reverse proxy like Nginx.

🚧 Problem:
When using a proxy, Express sees the proxy’s IP as the client’s IP. Also, it may not detect if the original request was HTTPS or HTTP.

app.set('trust proxy', 1);
This tells Express:

“Hey, trust the first proxy between the user and me.”

“Look at special headers like X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto to get the real user’s IP and if they used HTTPS.”


Proxy server importance and explanationhere:
=================================================== >

 When a request goes through a load balancer, cloud proxy, or reverse proxy before reaching your Express server, the app.set('trust proxy', 1) line is important.

Let’s break it down with a simple flow chart (text version), a real-world IP example, and a clear explanation of what trust proxy does.

🔁 Simple Flow Chart (Request Journey)
nginx

User Browser (IP: 123.45.67.89)
          ↓
Cloud Load Balancer (IP: 10.0.0.1)
          ↓
Your Express Server (IP: 192.168.0.2)
The user sends a request (maybe from a mobile app or browser).

The request first hits the Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx, Cloudflare).

Then the Load Balancer forwards the request to your Express server.

💡 Real Problem Without trust proxy
Without telling Express about the proxy:

Express sees the IP as 10.0.0.1 (proxy's IP), not the real user’s IP (123.45.67.89).

If you're using sessions, cookies, or security checks, things like req.secure and req.ip will be wrong.

✅ Solution With app.set('trust proxy', 1)

app.set('trust proxy', 1);
Tells Express: “Trust the first proxy” (usually the load balancer).

Now Express will:

Use X-Forwarded-For header to know real user IP.

Use X-Forwarded-Proto to know if request was made with HTTPS.

Set cookies with secure: true correctly, because it knows HTTPS was used by the client.

🧠 What trust proxy does:
Feature	Without trust proxy	With trust proxy
req.ip	Proxy IP	Real user IP
req.secure	false	true (if HTTPS used)
Secure cookies	Not sent	Sent correctly

🧾 IP Example:
User (real IP): 123.45.67.89
Load Balancer adds header:

X-Forwarded-For: 123.45.67.89
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
Then Express (with trust proxy) will read:


req.ip => '123.45.67.89'
req.secure => true
📌 When to Use app.set('trust proxy', 1)
Use it when:

Your app is behind 1 proxy (most cloud environments like Heroku, AWS, Vercel).

You're using HTTPS, sessions, or need the real IP.

You're using secure cookies (secure: true in express-session).
